// A structure is a user defined data types.A structure creates a data type that cann be used to group items of possibly different data types into a single type.

// The struct keyword is used to create a structure.
// Examp => structure detail{
    // member1,
    // memeber2
}

// Structure in c++ contains two types of members.
// (1) => data members => These members are normal C++ variables. We can create a structure with variables of different data types in C++.
// (2) => Member functions =>  These members are normal C++ functions. Along with variables, we can also include functions inside a structure declaration.
