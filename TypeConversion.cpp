// Type conversion in c++
// The Implicit Type Conversion is that type conversion that is done automatically by the compiler. It does not require any effort from the programmer. The C++ compiler has a set of predefined rules. Based on these rules, the compiler automatically converts one data type to another. implicit type conversion is also known as automatic type conversion.

// Data Loss During Conversion
// When there is more than one data type present in an expression, there is a possibility of data loss because different data types are not compatible with each other. Data loss occurs if a variable converts from a higher data type to a lower data type. In order to avoid data loss, the compiler automatically converts all the data types to the highest data type present in the expression. This is called promotion

// Explicit type conversion
// Explicit Type Conversions are those conversions that are done by the programmer manually. In other words, explicit conversion allows the programmer to typecast (change) the data type of a variable to another type. Hence, it is also called typecasting. Generally, we use the explicit type conversion if we do not want to follow the implicit type conversion rules.

// Explicit type conversion in C++ can be done in two ways:

// Conversion using the Assignment Operator
// Conversion using the Cast Operator
