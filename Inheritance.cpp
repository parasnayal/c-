// The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

// Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.

// When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing the properties of base class and may add new features to its own. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.

// Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class. 
// Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass is called Base Class or Superclass. 

// Types of Inheritance in c++
// (1) Single Inheritance
// (2) Multiple Inheritance
// (3) Hierarchical Inheritance
// (4) Multilevel Inheritance
// (5) Hybrid Inheritance

// Single Inheritance => A derived class with only one base class.
// Example => A -> B
// Example => A <- B (B is derived from A)

// Multiple Inheritance => A derived class with more than one Base class.

//  Hierarchical Inheritance => Several derived class from a single base class.

// Multilevel Inheritance => Deriving a class from already derived class.
// Example => A->B->C

// Hybrid Inheritance => Hybrid Inheritance is a combinatioin of  Multiple Inheritance and Multilevel Inheritance.
// A class is derived from two classes as in in  Multiple Inheritance.
// However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
